This is a random grid system generator for digital formats of height and width ranging from 500 to 2000 px.

It generates up to 15 columns and 15 rows, margins up to 200 px and gutters from 4 to 20 px.

You are welcome to use this to kickstart your graphic design work — just press 'S' when an appropriate canvas is generated to save it as a .png. Feel free to edit the code to suit your needs as well.
